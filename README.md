# Steam-Data-Analysis


## Introduction

Steam has been the household name for PC gaming since it was released. It has very few successful competitors, and those that have been a threat to its hegemony have done so at great cost. Epic Games Store is one such, which has attracted many publishers through paid timed exclusives and taking lower cuts on sales. The only other storefronts of note are Humble Bundle and GOG, both with particular niche selling points. The former sells combined packs of game and software while the latter prides itself on DRM free games.

In the face of these competitors, Steam has released various new features and programs to develop its platform. In this document, we'll be looking at the general health of Steam since its inception, as well as the growth of a few of its programs such Early Access, Achievements, Cloud, Workshop, Trading Cards and more.
